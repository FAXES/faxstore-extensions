## FaxStore - Release Watcher

This is a simple FaxStore extension that uses [FaxStore Events](https://docs.faxes.zone/c/faxstore/events) to create an embed and send it into a specified channel when a release for a product is created. This is basically the same one seen in [FAXES](https://faxes.zone) product update channel.

## Installation
 - Fill out the config at thte top on the file
 - Drag the `Release Watcher.js` file into your `extensions` folder.
 - Restart FaxStore and be sure to make sure the extension starts correctly.
